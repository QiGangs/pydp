# Overview

PyDP is library for implementing Dirichlet Process mixture models (DPMM). The goal of PyDP is to provide a pure Python 
implementation of various algorithms for working DPMMs. As a design choice PyDP should have no dependencies on any 
libraries which are not supported by the [PyPy](http://pypy.org) Python interpreter.
